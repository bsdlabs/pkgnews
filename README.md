PKGNews

Tool that lists and tracks read news items for FreeBSD ports `UPDATING`, without the need to have local ports tree installed. Similar to Gentoo's `eselect news` module, it:

* Lists unread UPDATING entries (default behavior)
* Displays individual UPDATING entries
* Marks them read or unread
