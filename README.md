#pkgnews

Tool that lists and tracks read news items for FreeBSD ports `UPDATING`, without the need to have local ports tree installed.

Similar to Gentoo's `eselect news` module, it provides the following functionality:

Unified list of NEWS:

* Lists unread UPDATING entries (default behavior)
* Lists ports deleted or moved via MOVED entry
* Lists warnings about soon-to-expire, and expired, installed PKGs

Individual management of those NEWS items:

* Displays individual UPDATING or MOVED entries
* Marks them read or unread
